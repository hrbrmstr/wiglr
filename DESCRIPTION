Description: 'WiGLE' consolidates location and information of wireless networks 
    world-wide to a central database, and has both a user-friendly desktop+web 
    application plus rich API that can map, query and update the location database. 
    Non-commerical use of the data is bound by the 'WiGLE' EULA <https://wigle.net/eula.html>.
    Use of the API requires a 'WiGLE' API key <https://wigle.net/account>.
